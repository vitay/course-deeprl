Skinner\n\n* **1950s**: optimal control, Markov Decision Process, dynamic programming\n\n    * Richard Bellman, Ronald Howard\n\n* **1970s**: trial-and-error learning\n\n    * Marvin Minsky, Harry Klopf, Robert Rescorla, Allan Wagner\n\n* **1980s**: temporal difference learning, Q-learning\n\n    * Richard Sutton, Andrew Barto, Christopher Watkins, Peter Dayan\n\n* **2013-now**: deep reinforcement learning\n\n    * Deepmind (Mnih, Silver, Graves...)\n    * OpenAI (Sutskever, Schulman...)\n    * Sergey Levine (Berkeley)\n\n\n\nReinforcement learning comes from animal behavior studies, especially **operant conditioning / instrumental learning**. **Thorndike’s Law of Effect** (1874–1949) suggested that behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated and those that produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated. Positive reinforcements (**rewards**) or negative reinforcements (**punishments**) can be used to modify behavior (**Skinner's box, 1936**). This form of learning applies to all animals, including humans:\n\n* Training (animals, children...)\n\n* Addiction, economics, gambling, psychological manipulation... \n\n**Behaviorism:** only behavior matters, not mental states.\n\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/y-g2OmRXb0g' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\n\nThe key concept of RL is **trial and error** learning. The agent (rat, robot, algorithm) tries out an **action** and observes the **outcome**.\n\n* If the outcome is positive (reward), the action is reinforced (more likely to occur again).\n* If the outcome is negative (punishment), the action will be avoided.\n\nAfter enough interactions, the agent has **learned** which action to perform in a given situation.\n\nRL is merely a formalization of the trial-and-error learning paradigm. The agent has to **explore** its environment via trial-and-error in order to gain knowledge. The biggest issue with this approach is that exploring large action spaces might necessitate a **lot** of trials (**sample complexity**). The modern techniques we will see in this course try to reduce the sample complexity.\n\n\n## The agent-environment interface\n\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/QjhKJmFV8T4' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\n\n```{figure} ../img/rl-agent.jpg\n---\nwidth: 80%\n---\nAgent-environment interface. Source: {cite}`Sutton2017`.\n```\n\nThe agent and the environment interact at discrete time steps:  $t$=0, 1, ... The agent observes its state at time t:  $s_t \\in \\mathcal{S}$, produces an action at time t, depending on the available actions in the current state: $a_t \\in \\mathcal{A}(s_t)$ and  receives a reward according to this action at time t+1: $r_{t+1} \\in \\Re$. It then updates its state: $s_{t+1} \\in \\mathcal{S}$. The behavior of the agent is therefore is a sequence of **state-action-reward-state** $(s, a, r, s')$ transitions.\n\n```{figure} ../img/rl-sequence.jpg\n---\nwidth: 100%\n---\nState-action-reward-state sequences. Source: {cite}`Sutton2017`.\n```\n\nSequences $\\tau = (s_0, a_0, r_1, s_1, a_1, \\ldots, s_T)$ are called **episodes**, **trajectories**, **histories** or **rollouts**.\n\n```{figure} ../img/rl-loop.png\n---\nwidth: 100%\n---\nAgent-environment interface for video games. Source: David Silver <https://www.davidsilver.uk/teaching/>.\n```\n\nThe state $s_t$ can relate to:\n\n* the **environment state**, i.e. all information external to the agent (position of objects, other agents, etc).\n\n* the **internal state**, information about the agent itself (needs, joint positions, etc).\n\nGenerally, the state represents all the information necessary to solve the task. The agent generally has no access to the states directly, but to **observations** $o_t$:\n\n$$\n    o_t = f(s_t)\n$$\n\nExample: camera inputs do not contain all the necessary information such as the agent's position. Imperfect information define **partially observable problems**.\n\n\nWhat we search in RL is the optimal **policy**: which action $a$ should the agent perform in a state $s$? The policy $\\pi$ maps states into actions. It is defined as a **probability distribution** over states and actions:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n    \\pi &: \\mathcal{S} \\times \\mathcal{A} \\rightarrow P(\\mathcal{S})\\\\\n    \\\\\n    & (s, a) \\rightarrow \\pi(s, a)  = P(a_t = a | s_t = s) \\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n$\\pi(s, a)$ is the probability of selecting the action $a$ in $s$. We have of course: \n\n$$\\sum_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}(s)} \\pi(s, a) = 1$$\n\nPolicies can be **probabilistic** / **stochastic**. **Deterministic policies** select a single action $a^*$in $s$:\n\n$$\\pi(s, a) = \\begin{cases} 1 \\; \\text{if} \\; a = a^* \\\\ 0 \\; \\text{if} \\; a \\neq a^* \\\\ \\end{cases}$$\n\n\nThe only teaching signal in RL is the **reward function**. The reward is a scalar value $r_{t+1}$ provided to the system after each transition $(s_t,a_t, s_{t+1})$. Rewards can also be probabilistic (casino). The mathematical expectation of these rewards defines the **expected reward** of a transition: \n\n$$\n    r(s, a, s') = \\mathbb{E}_t [r_{t+1} | s_t = s, a_t = a, s_{t+1} = s']\n$$\n\nRewards can be:\n\n* **dense**: a non-zero value is provided after each time step (easy).\n\n* **sparse**: non-zero rewards are given very seldom (difficult).\n\nThe goal of the agent is to find a policy that **maximizes** the sum of future rewards at each timestep. The discounted sum of future rewards is called the **return**:\n\n$$\n    R_t = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\gamma ^k \\, r_{t+k+1}\n$$\n\nRewards can be delayed w.r.t to an action: we care about all future rewards to select an action, not only the immediate ones.  Example: in chess, the first moves are as important as the last ones in order to win, but they do not receive reward.\n\n\nThe **expected return** in a state $s$ is called its **value**:\n\n$$\n    V^\\pi(s) = \\mathbb{E}_\\pi(R_t | s_t = s)\n$$\n\nThe value of a state defines how good it is to be in that state. If a state has a high value, it means we will be able to collect a lot of rewards **on the long term** and **on average**.  Value functions are central to RL: if we know the value of all states, we can infer the policy. The optimal action is the one that leads to the state with the highest value. Most RL methods deal with estimating the value function from experience (trial and error).\n\n\n**Simple maze**\n\n```{figure} ../img/maze.png\n---\nwidth: 80%\n---\nSimple maze. Source: David Silver <http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html>.\n```\n\nThe goal is to find a path from start to goal as fast as possible.\n\n* **States**: position in the maze (1, 2, 3...).\n\n* **Actions**: up, down, left, right.\n\n* **Rewards**: -1 for each step until the exit.\n\n\nThe value of each state indicates how good it is to be in that state. It can be learned by trial-and-error given a policy.\n\n```{figure} ../img/maze-value.png\n---\nwidth: 80%\n---\nValue of each state. Source: David Silver <http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html>.\n```\n\nWhen the value of all states is known, we can infer the optimal policy by choosing actions leading to the states with the highest value.\n\n```{figure} ../img/maze-policy.png\n---\nwidth: 80%\n---\nOptimal policy.

Credit assignment.\n\n* **Time** matters: as behavior gets better, the observed data changes.\n\n\n## Applications of tabular RL\n\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/EGI89ypJiv4' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\n### Pendulum\n\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/v6IEpH4vYq0' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\n\n### Cartpole\n\n```{figure} ../img/cartpole-before.gif\n---\nwidth: 60%\n---\nCartpole before training.

It is only when coupled with **deep neural networks** that interesting applications of RL became possible. Deepmind (now Google) started the deep RL hype in 2013 by learning to solve 50+ Atari games with a CNN, the **deep Q-network** (DQN) {cite}`Mnih2013`.\n\n```{figure} ../img/discrete.png\n---\nwidth: 100%\n---\nArchitecture of the deep Q-network.

It may be AI's best shot at producing intelligent behavior, as it does not rely on annotated data. A lot of problems have to be solved before becoming as mainstream as deep learning.\n\n* Sample complexity is often prohibitive.\n* Energy consumption and computing power simply crazy (AlphaGo: 1 MW, Dota2: 800 petaflop/s-days)\n* The correct reward function is hard to design, ethical aspects. (*inverse RL*)\n* Hard to incorporate expert knowledge. (*model-based RL*)\n* Learns single tasks, does not generalize (*hierarchical RL*, *meta-learning*)\n\n\n## Suggested readings\n\n* Sutton and Barto (1998, 2017).
