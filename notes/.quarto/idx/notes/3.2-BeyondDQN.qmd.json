But suppose that, after learning, you can only try a **single** action. Which one do you chose?  RL does not distinguish safe from risky actions.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Example\n\n![](../slides/img/distributional-example.svg){width=70%}\n\nThe trip by train from Leipzig to Chemnitz takes 1 hour if everything goes well. Once a week on average, the train will get stuck on the way for 30 minutes. The expected duration of the trip is 1h + 1/5*30 = 1h06. But in practice it takes either 1h or 1h30, never 1h06. If driving by car always takes 1h15, it might be worth it if you have an urgent appointment that day.\n:::\n\n### Categorical learning\n\nThe idea of **distributional RL** is to learn the **distribution of returns** $\\mathcal{Z}^\\pi$ directly instead of its expectation:\n\n$$R_t \\sim \\mathcal{Z}^\\pi(s_t, a_t)$$\n\n![Distribution of returns for a given state.](../slides/img/distributionallearning.png){width=80%}\n\nNote that we can always obtain the Q-values back:\n\n$$Q^\\pi(s, a) = \\mathbb{E}_\\pi [\\mathcal{Z}^\\pi(s, a)]$$\n\nIn categorical DQN [@Bellemare2017], they model the distribution of returns as a **discrete probability distribution**: the **categorical** or **multinouilli** distribution. One first needs to identify the minimum and maximum returns $R_\\text{min}$ and $R_\\text{max}$ possible in the problem.\nOne then splits the range $[R_\\text{min}, R_\\text{max}]$ in $n$ **discrete bins** centered on the atoms $\\{z_i\\}_{i=1}^N$.\n\nThe probability that the return obtained the action $(s, a)$ lies in the bin of the atom $z_i$ is noted $p_i(s, a)$. It can be approximated by a neural network $F$ with parameters $\\theta$, using a **softmax output layer**: \n\n$$\n    p_i(s, a; \\theta) = \\frac{\\exp F_i(s, a; \\theta)}{\\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\exp F_j(s, a; \\theta)}\n$$\n\nThe $n$ probabilities $\\{p_i(s, a; \\theta)\\}_{i=1}^N$ completely define the parameterized distribution $\\mathcal{Z}_\\theta(s, a)$.\n\n$$\\mathcal{Z}_\\theta(s, a) = \\sum_a p_i(s, a; \\theta) \\,\\delta_{z_i}$$\n\nwhere $\\delta_{z_i}$is a Dirac distribution centered on the atom $z_i$. The Q-value of an action can be obtained by:\n\n$$\n    Q_\\theta(s, a) = \\mathbb{E} [\\mathcal{Z}_\\theta(s, a)] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i(s, a; \\theta) \\, z_i\n$$\n\n![Categorical DQN outputs the distribution of returns for each action using a softmax output layer. Source: <https://physai.sciencesconf.org/data/pages/distributional_RL_Remi_Munos.pdf>](../slides/img/categorical-dqn.png){width=30%}\n\nThe only thing we need is a neural network $\\theta$ returning for each action $a$ in the state $s$ a discrete probability distribution $\\mathcal{Z}_\\theta(s, a)$ instead of a single Q-value $Q_\\theta(s, a)$. The NN uses a **softmax activation function** for each action. Action selection is similar to DQN: we first compute the $Q_\\theta(s, a)$ and apply greedy / $\\epsilon$-greedy / softmax over the actions.\n\n$$\n    Q_\\theta(s, a) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i(s, a; \\theta) \\, z_i\n$$\n\nThe number $n$ of atoms for each action should be big enough to represent the range of returns.  A number that works well with Atari games is $n=51$: Categorical DQN is often noted **C51**.\n\n### Distributional Bellman target\n\nHow do we learn the distribution of returns $\\mathcal{Z}_\\theta(s, a)$ of parameters $\\{p_i(s, a; \\theta)\\}_{i=1}^N$? In Q-learning, we minimize the mse between the prediction $Q_\\theta(s, a)$ and the **target**:\n\n$$\\mathcal{T} \\, Q_\\theta(s, a) = r + \\gamma \\, Q_\\theta(s', a')$$\n\nwhere $\\mathcal{T}$ is the Bellman operator.\n\n$$\\min_\\theta (\\mathcal{T} \\, Q_\\theta(s, a) - Q_\\theta(s, a))^2$$\n\nWe do the same here: we apply the **Bellman operator** on the distribution $\\mathcal{Z}_\\theta(s, a)$.\n\n$$\\mathcal{T} \\, \\mathcal{Z}_\\theta(s, a) = r(s, a) + \\gamma \\, \\mathcal{Z}_\\theta(s', a')$$\n\nWe then minimize the statistical \"distance\" between the distributions $\\mathcal{Z}_\\theta(s, a)$ and $\\mathcal{T} \\, \\mathcal{Z}_\\theta(s, a)$.\n\n$$\\min_\\theta \\text{KL}(\\mathcal{T} \\, \\mathcal{Z}_\\theta(s, a) || \\mathcal{Z}_\\theta(s, a))$$\n\nLet's note $P^\\pi \\, \\mathcal{Z}$ the return distribution of the greedy action in the next state $\\mathcal{Z}_\\theta(s', a')$. \n\nMultiplying the returns by the discount factor $\\gamma < 1$ **shrinks** the return distribution (its support gets smaller). The **atoms** $z_i$ of $\\mathcal{Z}_\\theta(s', a')$ now have the position $\\gamma \\, z_i$, but the probabilities stay the same.\n\n![Multiplying the returns by $\\gamma < 1$ shrinks the supports of the distribution.

The probabilities do not change, but the new position of the atoms is:\n\n$$z'_i = r + \\gamma \\, z_i$$\n\n![Adding the reward translates the distribution. Source: <https://physai.sciencesconf.org/data/pages/distributional_RL_Remi_Munos.pdf>](../slides/img/distributional_bellman2.png){width=90%}\n\nBut now we have a problem: the atoms $z'_i$ of $\\mathcal{T} \\, \\mathcal{Z}_\\theta(s, a)$ do not match with the atoms $z_i$ of $\\mathcal{Z}_\\theta(s, a)$. We need to **interpolate** the target distribution to compare it with the predicted distribution. \n\nWe need to apply a **projection** $\\Phi$ so that the bins of $\\mathcal{T} \\, \\mathcal{Z}_\\theta(s, a)$ are the same as the ones of $\\mathcal{Z}_\\theta(s, a)$. The formula sounds complicated, but it is basically a linear interpolation:\n\n$$\n    (\\Phi \\, \\mathcal{T} \\, \\mathcal{Z}_\\theta(s, a))_i = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\big [1 - \\frac{| [\\mathcal{T}\\, z_j]_{R_\\text{min}}^{R_\\text{max}} - z_i|}{\\Delta z} \\big ]_0^1 \\, p_j (s', a'; \\theta)\n$$\n\n![The Bellman target distribution $\\mathcal{T} \\, \\mathcal{Z}_\\theta(s, a)$ must be projected to match the support of $\\mathcal{Z}_\\theta(s, a)$. Source: <https://physai.sciencesconf.org/data/pages/distributional_RL_Remi_Munos.pdf>](../slides/img/distributional_bellman3.png){width=90%}\n\nWe now have two distributions $\\mathcal{Z}_\\theta(s, a)$ and $\\Phi \\, \\mathcal{T} \\, \\mathcal{Z}_\\theta(s, a)$ sharing the same support. We now want to have the prediction $\\mathcal{Z}_\\theta(s, a)$ close from the target $\\Phi \\, \\mathcal{T} \\, \\mathcal{Z}_\\theta(s, a)$. These are probability distributions, not numbers, so we cannot use the mse. We instead minimize the **Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence** between the two distributions. \n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence \n\nLet's consider a parameterized discrete distribution $X_\\theta$ and a discrete target distribution $T$. The KL divergence between the two distributions is:\n\n$$\\text{KL}(X_\\theta || T) = \\mathbb{E}_T [- T \\, \\log \\, \\frac{X_\\theta}{T}]$$\n\nIt can be rewritten as the sum of the **cross-entropy** and the entropy of $T$:\n\n$$\\text{KL}(X_\\theta || T) = \\mathbb{E}_T [- T \\, \\log \\, X_\\theta + T \\, \\log T] = H(X_\\theta, T) - H(T)$$\n\nAs $T$ does not depend on $\\theta$, the gradient of the KL divergence w.r.t to $\\theta$ is the same as the gradient of the cross-entropy.\n\n$$\\nabla_\\theta \\, \\text{KL}(X_\\theta || T) = \\nabla_\\theta \\,  \\mathbb{E}_T [- T \\, \\log \\, X_\\theta]$$\n\n**Minimizing the KL divergence is the same as minimizing the cross-entropy.** Neural networks with a softmax output layer and the cross-entropy loss function can do that.\n:::\n\n### Categorical DQN\n\nThe categorical DQN algorithm follows the main lines of DQN, with the additional step of prohecting the distributions:\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Categorical DQN\n\n* Initialize distributional value network $Z_{\\theta}$ and target network $Z_{\\theta'}$.\n\n* Initialize experience replay memory $\\mathcal{D}$ of maximal size $N$.\n\n* for $t \\in [0, T_\\text{total}]$:\n\n    * Select an action $a_t$ based on $Q_\\theta(s_t, a)$, observe $s_{t+1}$ and $r_{t+1}$.\n\n    * Store $(s_t, a_t, r_{t+1}, s_{t+1})$ in the experience replay memory.\n\n    * Every $T_\\text{train}$ steps:\n\n        * Sample a minibatch $\\mathcal{D}_s$ randomly from $\\mathcal{D}$.\n\n        * For each transition $(s_k, a_k, r_k, s'_k)$ in the minibatch:\n\n            * Select the greedy action in the next state using the target network:\n\n            $$a'_k = \\text{argmax}_a \\, Q_{\\theta'}(s'_k, a) = \\text{argmax}_a \\, \\mathbb{E}[Z_{\\theta'}(s'_k, a)]$$\n\n            * Apply the Bellman operator on the distribution of the next greedy action:\n\n            $$TZ_k = r_k + \\gamma \\, Z_{\\theta'}(s'_k, a'_k)$$\n\n            * Project this distribution to the support of $Z_\\theta(s_k, a_k)$.\n\n            $$\\mathbf{t}_k = \\text{Projection}(TZ_k, Z_\\theta(s_k, a_k))$$\n\n        * Update the value network $Q_{\\theta}$ on $\\mathcal{D}_s$ to minimize the cross-entropy:\n\n        $$\\mathcal{L}(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathcal{D}_s}[ - \\mathbf{t}_k \\, \\log Z_\\theta(s_k, a_k)]$$\n:::\n\nIn practice, the computation of the cross-entropy loss is described in [@Bellemare2017]:\n\n![Computation of the cross-entropy loss in [@Bellemare2017].](../slides/img/categorical-dqn-algo.png){width=70%}\n\nHaving the full distribution of returns allow to deal with **uncertainty**. For certain actions in critical states, one could get a high return (killing an enemy) or no return (death). The distribution reflects that the agent is not certain of the goodness of the action.

The exploration parameter $\\epsilon$ is **annealed** during training to reach a final minimal value. It is preferred to **softmax** action selection, where $\\tau$ scales with the unknown Q-values. The problem is that it is a global exploration mechanism: well-learned states do not need as much exploration as poorly explored ones. \n\n\n![The exploration parameter $\\epsilon$ or $\\tau$ is **annealed** during learning to solve the exploration/exploitation trade-off.

What about adding noise to the **parameters** (weights and biases) of the DQN, what would change the greedy action everytime? Controlling the level of noise inside the neural network indirectly controls the exploration level.\n\n![Instead of adding noise to the output (greedy action), we could add noise to the parameters of the neural network.

Instead of learning a single value of the parameters:\n\n$$y = \\theta_1 \\, x + \\theta_0$$\n\nwe learn the **distribution** of the parameters, for example by assuming they come from a normal distribution:\n\n$$\\theta \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_\\theta, \\sigma_\\theta^2)$$\n\nFor each new input, we **sample** a value for the parameter:\n\n$$\\theta = \\mu_\\theta + \\sigma_\\theta \\, \\epsilon$$\n\nwith $\\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ a random variable. The prediction $y$ will vary for the same input depending on the variances:\n\n$$y = (\\mu_{\\theta_1} + \\sigma_{\\theta_1} \\, \\epsilon_1) \\, x + \\mu_{\\theta_0} + \\sigma_{\\theta_0} \\, \\epsilon_0$$\n\nThe mean and variance of each parameter can be learned through backpropagation!\n\n![Bayesian deep learning learns a distribution of weights. Source: <https://ericmjl.github.io/bayesian-deep-learning-demystified>](../slides/img/noisydqn.png){width=40%}\n\nAs the random variables $\\epsilon_i  \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ are not correlated with anything, the variances $\\sigma_\\theta^2$ should decay to 0. The variances $\\sigma_\\theta^2$ represent the **uncertainty** about the prediction $y$. \n\nApplied to DQN, this means that a state which has not been visited very often will have a high uncertainty: The predicted Q-values will change a lot between two evaluations, so the greedy action might change: **exploration**. Conversely, a well-explored state will have a low uncertainty: The greedy action stays the same: **exploitation**.\n\nNoisy DQN [@Fortunato2017] uses **greedy action selection** over noisy Q-values. The level of exploration is **learned** by the network on a per-state basis. No need for scheduling! **Parameter noise** improves the performance of $\\epsilon$-greedy-based methods, including DQN, dueling DQN, A3C, DDPG (see later), etc.\n\n![Noisy networks outperform their $\\epsilon$-soft variants.

Interestingly, double Q-learning does not have a huge effect on the Rainbow network: The other mechanisms (especially distributional learning) already ensure that Q-values are not over-estimated.\n\nYou can find good implementations of Rainbow DQN on all major frameworks, for example on `rllib`:\n\n<https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/rllib-algorithms.html#deep-q-networks-dqn-rainbow-parametric-dqn>\n\n## Distributed learning\n\n{{< youtube  W468iYOpCsE >}}\n\n### Gorila - General Reinforcement Learning Architecture\n\nThe DQN value network $Q_\\theta(s, a)$ has two jobs:\n\n* **actor:** it interacts with the environment to sample $(s, a, r, s')$ transitions.\n* **learner:** it learns from minibatches out of the replay memory.\n\n \n![The DQN value network is both an actor and a learner, as it needs to sequentially select actions and learn from the replay memory. Source: [@Nair2015].](../slides/img/gorila1.png){width=90%}\n\n\nThe weights of the value network lie on the same CPU/GPU, so the two jobs have to be done sequentially: **computational bottleneck**. DQN cannot benefit from **parallel computing**: multi-core CPU, clusters of CPU/GPU, etc.\n\nThe Gorila framework [@Nair2015] splits DQN into **multiple actors** and **multiple learners**. Each actor (or worker) **interacts** with its copy of the environment and stores transitions in a distributed replay buffer. Each learner samples minibatches from the replay buffer and computes **gradients** w.r.t the DQN loss. The parameter server (**master network**) applies the gradients on the parameters and frequently **synchronizes** the actors and learners.\n\n\n![The Gorila framework uses multiple actors to collect transitions and store them in the ERM.

Distributed SGD (computing gradients with different learners) is not very efficient. What matters is collecting transitions very quickly (multiple workers) but using **prioritized experience replay** to learn from the most interesting ones.\n\n![](../img/apex.png)\n\nUsing 360 workers (1 per CPU core), Ape-X [@Horgan2018] reaches super-human performance for a fraction of the wall-clock training time.\n\n![](../img/apex-results.png)\n\nThe multiple parallel workers can collect much more frames, leading to the better performance. The learner uses n-step returns and the double dueling DQN network architecture, so it is not much different from Rainbow DQN internally.\n\n![](../img/apex-results2.png)\n\n## Recurrent DQN\n\n{{< youtube  DOltPe7XGMA >}}\n\n### DRQN: Deep Recurrent Q-network\n\nAtari games are POMDP: each frame is a **partial observation**, not a Markov state.
