When a stone is surrounded by four opponents, it dies. The goal is to ensure strategical position in order to cover the biggest territory. There are around $10^{170}$ possible states and 250 actions available at each turn ($10^{761}$ possible games), making it a much harder game than chess for a computer (35 possible actions, $10^{120}$ possible games). A game lasts 150 moves on average (80 in chess). Up until 2015 and **AlphaGo**, Go AIs could not compete with world-class experts, and people usually considered AI would need at least another 20 years to solve it.\n\n\n### Minimax and Alpha-Beta\n\n![Example of a game tree.](../slides/img/minimax.png){width=100%}\n\n**Minimax** algorithm expand the whole game tree, simulating the moves of the MAX (you) and MIN (your opponent) players.\nThe final outcome (win or lose) is assigned to the leaves.\nIt allows to solve **zero sum games**: what MAX wins is lost by MIN, and vice-versa. We suppose MIN plays optimally (i.e. in his own interest).\n\n![Minimax iteratively backpropagates the value of the leaves according to who plays.](../slides/img/minimax-sol.png){width=100%}\n\nThe value of the leaves is propagated backwards to the starting position: MAX chooses the action leading to the state with the highest value, MIN does the opposite.\nFor most games, the tree becomes too huge for such a systematic search:\n* The value of all states further than a couple of moves away are approximated by a **heuristic function**: the value $V(s)$ of these states.\n* Obviously useless parts of the tree are pruned: **Alpha-Beta** algorithm.\n\nAlpha-Beta methods work well for simple problems where the complete game tree can be manipulated: Tic-Tac-Toe has only a couple of possible states and actions ($3^9 = 19000$ states).\n\n![Game tree of tic-tac-toe.](../slides/img/tictactoe.jpg){width=100%}\n\nIt also works when precise heuristics can be derived in a reasonable time.\nThis is the principle of **IBM DeepBlue** which was the first Chess AI to beat a world champion (Garry Kasparov) in 1995.\nCarefully engineered heuristics (with the help of chess masters) allowed DeepBlue to search 6 moves away what is the best situation it can arrive in.\n\nBut it does not work in Go because its branching factor (250 actions possible from each state) is to huge: the tree explodes very soon.\n$250^{6} \\approx 10^{15}$, so even if your processor evaluates 1 billion nodes per second, it would need 11 days to evaluate a single position 6 moves away...\n\n![Game (sub-)tree of Go.

Source: [@Silver2016].](../slides/img/mcts.png){width=100%}\n\nThe final AlphaGo player uses **Monte-Carlo Tree Search** (MCTS), which is an incremental tree search (depth-limited), biased by the Q-value of known transitions.\nThe game tree is traversed depth-first from the current state, but the order of the visits depends on the value of the transition.\nMCTS was previously the standard approach for Go AIs, but based on expert moves only, not deep networks. One step of MCTS consists of four phases:\n\n#### Selection phase\n\nIn the **selection phase**, a path is found in the tree of possible actions using **Upper Confidence Bound** (UCB).\nThe probability of selecting an action when sampling the tree depends on:\n* Its Q-value $Q(s, a)$ (as learned by MCTS): how likely this action leads to winning.\n* Its prior probability: how often human players would play it, given by the SL policy network $\\rho_\\sigma$.\n* Its number of visits $N(s, a)$: this ensures exploration during the sampling.\n\n$$a_t = \\text{argmax}_a \\, Q(s, a) + K \\cdot \\frac{P(s, a)}{1 + N(s, a)}$$\n\n#### Expansion phase\n\nIn the **expansion phase**, a leaf state $s_L$ of the game tree is reached.\nThe leaf is **expanded**, and the possible successors of that state are added to the tree.\nOne requires a **model** to know which states are possible successors, but this is very easy in Go.\n\n$$s_{t+1} = f(s_t, a_t)$$\n\nThe tree therefore grows every time a **Monte-Carlo sampling** (\"episode\") is done.\n\n\n#### Evaluaiton phase\n\nIn the **evaluation phase**, the leaf $s_L$ is evaluated both by\n* the RL value network $\\nu_\\theta$ (how likely can we win from that state)\n* a random rollout until the end of the game using the fast rollout policy $\\rho_\\pi$.\n\nThe random rollout consists in \"emulating\" the end of the game using the fast rollout policy network.\nThe rollout is of course imperfect, but complements the value network: they are more accurate together than alone!\n\n$$V(s_L) = (1 - \\lambda)  \\, \\nu_\\theta(s_L) + \\lambda \\, R_\\text{rollout} $$\n\nThis solves the bias/variance trade-off.\n\n#### Backup phase\n\nIn the **backup phase**, the Q-values of all actions taken when descending the tree are updated with the value of the leaf node:\n\n$$Q(s, a) = \\frac{1}{N(s, a)} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} V(s_L^i) $$\n\nThis is a Monte Carlo method: perform one episode and update the Q-value of all taken actions. \nHowever, it never uses real rewards, only value estimates.\nThe Q-values are **learned** by using both the learned value of future states (value network) and internal simulations (rollout).\n\n\nThe four phases are then repeated as long as possible (time is limited in Go), to expand the game tree as efficiently as possible.\nThe game tree is repeatedly sampled and grows after each sample.\nWhen the time is up, the greedy action (highest Q-value) in the initial state is chosen and played.\nFor the next move, the tree is reset and expanded again (MPC replanning).\n\nIn the end, during MCTS, only the value network $\\nu_\\theta$, the SL policy network $\\rho_\\sigma$ and the fast rollout policy $\\rho_\\pi$ are used.\nThe RL policy network $\\rho_\\rho$ is only used to train the value network $\\nu_\\theta$. i.e. to predict which positions are interesting or not.\nHowever, the RL policy network can discover new strategies by playing many times against itself, without relying on averaging expert moves like the previous approaches.\n\nAlphaGo was able to beat Lee Sedol in 2016, 19 times World champion.\nIt relies on human knowledge to **bootstrap** a RL agent (supervised learning).\nThe RL agent discovers new strategies by using self-play: during the games against Lee Sedol, it was able to use **novel** moves which were never played before and surprised its opponent.\nThe neural networks are only used to guide random search using MCTS: the policy network alone is not able to beat grandmasters.\nTraining took several weeks on 1202 CPUs and 176 GPUs.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## But is Go that hard compared to robotics?\n\n1. **Fully deterministic.** There is no noise in the rules of the game; if the two players take the same sequence of actions, the states along the way will always be the same.\n2. **Fully observed.** Each player has complete information and there are no hidden variables. For example, Texas hold’em does not satisfy this property because you cannot see the cards of the other player.\n3. The action space is **discrete**. A number of unique moves are available. In contrast, in robotics you might want to instead emit continuous-valued torques at each joint.\n4. We have access to a perfect **simulator** (the game itself), so the effects of any action are known exactly. This is a strong assumption that AlphaGo relies on quite strongly, but is also quite rare in other real-world problems.\n5. Each episode/game is relatively short, of approximately 200 actions. This is a relatively **short time horizon** compared to other RL settings which may involve thousands (or more) of actions per episode.\n6. The **evaluation** is clear, fast and allows a lot of trial-and-error experience. In other words, the agent can experience winning/losing millions of times, which allows is to learn, slowly but surely, as is common with deep neural network optimization.\n7. There are huge datasets of human play game data available to **bootstrap** the learning, so AlphaGo doesn’t have to start from scratch.\n\nSource: <https://medium.com/@karpathy/alphago-in-context-c47718cb95a5>\n:::\n\n## AlphaZero\n\n\n{{< youtube  fHpNbQEDIB8 >}}\n\n![Performance of AlphaZero [@Silver2018].

Train the neural network, using both A) the move evaluations produced by the MCTS lookahead search and B) whether the current player won or lost.\n5. Finally, every 1,000 iterations of steps 3-4, evaluate the current neural network against the previous best version; if it wins at least 55% of the games, begin using it to generate self-play games instead of the prior version.\n\nRepeat steps 3-4 700,000 times, while the self-play games are continuously being played .\n\nSource:<https://hackernoon.com/the-3-tricks-that-made-alphago-zero-work-f3d47b6686ef>\n:::\n\nBy using a single network instead of four and learning faster, AlphaZero also greatly reduces the energy consumption.\n\n![Power consumption of AlphaZero [@Silver2018].
