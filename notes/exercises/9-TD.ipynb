    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta Q(s_t, a_t) = \\alpha \\, (r_{t+1} + \\gamma \\, \\max_{a'} \\, Q(s_{t+1}, a') - Q(s_t, a_t))$$\n",

    "* Discount factor $\\gamma = 0.9$. \n",
    "* Learning rate $\\alpha = 0.1$.\n",
    "* Epsilon-greedy action selection, with an initial exploration parameter of 1.0 and an exponential decay of $10^{-5}$ after each update (i.e. every step!).\n",
    "* A total number of episodes of 20000.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep the general structure of the class: `train()` for the main loop, `test()` to run one episode without exploration, etc. Add a method to compute the discounted return of each episode, as it will not be done automatically by the `update()` method anymore. Plot the training and test performance in the end and render the learned deterministic policy for 10 episodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* if $s_{t+1}$ is terminal (`done` is true after the transition), the target should not be $r_{t+1} + \\gamma \\, \\max_{a'} \\, Q(s_{t+1}, a')$, but simply $r_{t+1}$ as there is no next action."
