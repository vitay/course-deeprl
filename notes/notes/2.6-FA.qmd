## Limits of tabular RL

{{< youtube  el6F6Drem88 >}}

All the methods seen so far belong to **tabular RL**. Q-learning necessitates to store in a **Q-table** one Q-value per state-action pair $(s, a)$.

![Tabular Q-learning. Source: <https://towardsdatascience.com/qrash-course-deep-q-networks-from-the-ground-up-1bbda41d3677>](../slides/img/qtable.gif){width=100%}

If a state has never been visited during learning, the Q-values will still be at their initial value (0.0), no policy can be derived.

![In high-dimensional state spaces (e.g. images), tabular RL cannot generalize between close states.](../slides/img/tabular-generalization.svg){width=60%}

Similar states likely have the same optimal action: we want to be able to **generalize** the policy between states. For most realistic problems, the size of the Q-table becomes quickly untractable. If you use black-and-white 256x256 images as inputs, you have $2^{256 * 256} = 10^{19728}$ possible states! **Tabular RL** is therefore limited to toy problems.

Tabular RL also only works for small **discrete action spaces**. Robots have **continuous action spaces**, where the actions are changes in **joint angles** or **torques**. A joint angle could for example take any value in $[0, \pi]$. A solution would be to **discretize** the action space (one action per degree), but we would fall into the **curse of dimensionality**.

The more degrees of freedom, the more discrete actions, the more entries in the Q-table... Tabular RL cannot deal with continuous action spaces, unless we approximate the policy with an **actor-critic** architecture.

### Feature vectors

Let's represent a state $s$ by a vector of $d$ **features** $\phi(s) = [\phi_1(s), \phi_2(s), \ldots, \phi_d(s)]^T$. For the cartpole, the feature vector would be:

$$ \phi(s) = \begin{bmatrix}x \\ \dot{x} \\ \theta \\ \dot{\theta} \end{bmatrix}$$

where $x$ is the position, $\theta$ the angle, $\dot{x}$ and $\dot{\theta}$ their derivatives. We are able to represent **any state** $s$ of the cartpole problem using these four variables.

For more complex problems, the feature vector should include all the necessary information (Markov property). Example of breakout:

$$
    \phi(s) = \begin{bmatrix}
        x \, \text{position of the paddle} \\ 
        x \, \text{position of the ball} \\ 
        y \, \text{position of the ball} \\ 
        x \, \text{speed of the ball} \\ 
        y \, \text{speed of the position} \\ 
        \text{presence of brick 1} \\ 
        \text{presence of brick 2} \\ 
        \vdots \\
    \end{bmatrix}
$$

In deep RL, we will **learn** these feature vectors, but let's suppose for now that we have them. 

Note that we can always fall back to the tabular case using **one-hot encoding** of the states:

$$
\phi(s_1) = \begin{bmatrix}1\\0\\0\\ \ldots\\ 0\end{bmatrix} \qquad
\phi(s_2) = \begin{bmatrix}0\\1\\0\\ \ldots\\ 0\end{bmatrix}\qquad
\phi(s_3) = \begin{bmatrix}0\\0\\1\\ \ldots\\ 0\end{bmatrix} \qquad \ldots
$$ 

But the idea is that we can represent states with much less values than the number of states:

$$d \ll |\mathcal{S}|$$

We can also represent **continuous state spaces** with feature vectors, as in cartpole.


### State value approximation

In **state value approximation**, we want to approximate the state value function $V^\pi(s)$ with a **parameterized function** $V_\varphi(s)$:

$$V_\varphi(s) \approx V^\pi(s)$$

![State value approximation.](../slides/img/functionapproximation-state.svg){width=80%}

The parameterized function can have any form. Its has a set of parameters $\varphi$ used to transform the feature vector $\phi(s)$ into an approximated value $V_\varphi(s)$.

The simplest function approximator (FA) is the **linear approximator**.

![Linear state value approximation.](../slides/img/functionapproximation-state-linear.svg){width=80%}

The approximated value is a linear combination of the features:

$$V_\varphi(s) = \sum_{i=1}^d w_i \, \phi_i(s) = \mathbf{w}^T \times \phi(s)$$

The **weight vector** $\mathbf{w} = [w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_d]^T$is the set of parameters $\varphi$ of the function. A linear approximator is a single **artificial neuron** (linear regression) without a bias.


Regardless the form of the function approximator, we want to find the parameters $\varphi$ making the approximated values $V_\varphi(s)$ as close as possible from the true values $V^\pi(s)$ for all states $s$. 

This is a **regression** problem, so we want to minimize the **mean-square error** between the two quantities:

$$ \min_\varphi \mathcal{L}(\varphi) = \mathbb{E}_{s \in \mathcal{S}} [ (V^\pi(s) - V_\varphi(s))^2]$$

The **loss function** $\mathcal{L}(\varphi)$ is minimal when the predicted values are close to the true ones on average over the state space.

Let's suppose for now that we know the true state values $V^\pi(s)$ for all states and that the parametrized function is **differentiable**. We can find the minimum of the loss function by applying **gradient descent** (GD) iteratively:

$$
    \Delta \varphi = - \eta \, \nabla_\varphi \mathcal{L}(\varphi)
$$

$\nabla_\varphi \mathcal{L}(\varphi)$ is the gradient of the loss function w.r.t to the parameters $\varphi$.

$$
    \nabla_\varphi \mathcal{L}(\varphi) = \begin{bmatrix}
        \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}(\varphi)}{\partial \varphi_1} \\
        \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}(\varphi)}{\partial \varphi_2} \\
        \ldots \\
        \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}(\varphi)}{\partial \varphi_K} \\
    \end{bmatrix}
$$

When applied repeatedly, GD converges to a local minimum of the loss function.

In order to minimize the mean square error, we will iteratively modify the parameters $\varphi$ according to:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \Delta \varphi = \varphi_{k+1} - \varphi_n & = - \eta \, \nabla_\varphi \mathcal{L}(\varphi) \\
    &\\
    & = - \eta \, \nabla_\varphi \mathbb{E}_{s \in \mathcal{S}} [ (V^\pi(s) - V_\varphi(s))^2] \\
    &\\
    & = \mathbb{E}_{s \in \mathcal{S}} [- \eta \, \nabla_\varphi  (V^\pi(s) - V_\varphi(s))^2] \\
    &\\
    & = \mathbb{E}_{s \in \mathcal{S}} [\eta \,  (V^\pi(s) - V_\varphi(s)) \, \nabla_\varphi V_\varphi(s)] \\
\end{aligned}
$$

As it would be too slow to compute the expectation on the whole state space (**batch algorithm**), we will sample the quantity:
    
$$\delta_\varphi = \eta \,  (V^\pi(s) - V_\varphi(s)) \, \nabla_\varphi V_\varphi(s)$$

and update the parameters with **stochastic gradient descent** (SGD).

If we sample $K$ states $s_i$ from the state space, we get:

$$
    \Delta \varphi = \eta \,  \frac{1}{K} \sum_{k=1}^K (V^\pi(s_k) - V_\varphi(s_k)) \, \nabla_\varphi V_\varphi(s_k)
$$

We can also sample a single state $s$ (online algorithm):

$$
    \Delta \varphi = \eta \, (V^\pi(s) - V_\varphi(s)) \, \nabla_\varphi V_\varphi(s)
$$

Unless stated otherwise, we will sample single states in this section, but beware that the parameter updates will be noisy (high variance).


The approximated value is a linear combination of the features:

$$V_\varphi(s) = \sum_{i=1}^d w_i \, \phi_i(s) = \mathbf{w}^T \times \phi(s)$$

The weights are updated using stochastic gradient descent:

$$
    \Delta \mathbf{w} = \eta \, (V^\pi(s) - V_\varphi(s)) \, \phi(s)
$$

This is the **delta learning rule** of linear regression and classification, with $\phi(s)$ being the input vector and $V^\pi(s) - V_\varphi(s)$ the prediction error.

The rule can be used with any function approximator, we only need to be able to differentiate it:

$$
    \Delta \varphi = \eta \, (V^\pi(s) - V_\varphi(s)) \, \nabla_\varphi V_\varphi(s)
$$

The problem is that we do not know $V^\pi(s)$, as it is what we are trying to estimate. We can replace $V^\pi(s)$ by a sampled estimate using Monte-Carlo or TD:

* **Monte-Carlo** function approximation:

$$
    \Delta \varphi = \eta \, (R_t - V_\varphi(s)) \, \nabla_\varphi V_\varphi(s)
$$

* **Temporal Difference** function approximation:

$$
    \Delta \varphi = \eta \, (r_{t+1} + \gamma \, V_\varphi(s') - V_\varphi(s)) \, \nabla_\varphi V_\varphi(s)
$$

    1. Generate an episode according to the current policy $\pi$ until a terminal state $s_T$ is reached.

    $$
        \tau = (s_o, a_o, r_ 1, s_1, a_1, \ldots, s_T)

        $$

        * **if** $s_{t+1}$ is terminal: **break**
:::

As in tabular RL, Gradient Monte-Carlo has no bias (real returns) but a high variance.
Semi-gradient TD has less variance, but a significant bias as $V_\varphi(s_{t+1})$ is initially wrong. You can never trust these estimates completely.


Note that for Temporal Difference, we actually want to minimize the TD reward-prediction error for all states, i.e. the surprise:

$$\mathcal{L}(\varphi) = \mathbb{E}_{s \in \mathcal{S}} [ (r_{t+1} + \gamma \, V_\varphi(s') - V_\varphi(s))^2]= \mathbb{E}_{s \in \mathcal{S}} [ \delta_t^2]$$

### Action value approximation

Q-values can be approximated by a parameterized function $Q_\theta(s, a)$ in the same manner. There are basically two options for the structure of the function approximator:


* The FA takes a feature vector for both the state $s$ and the action $a$ (which can be continuous) as inputs, and outputs a single Q-value $Q_\theta(s ,a)$. 

![Action value approximation for a single action.](../slides/img/functionapproximation-action1.svg){width=80%}

* The FA takes a feature vector for the state $s$ as input, and outputs one Q-value $Q_\theta(s ,a)$ per possible action (the action space must be discrete).

![Action value approximation for all actions.](../slides/img/functionapproximation-action2.svg){width=80%}

In both cases, we minimize the mse between the true value $Q^\pi(s, a)$ and the approximated value $Q_\theta(s, a)$.

        * Take $a_t$, observe $r_{t+1}$ and $s_{t+1}$.

        * Update the parameters $\theta$:

        $$\Delta \theta = \eta \, (r_{t+1} + \gamma \, \max_a Q_\theta(s_{t+1}, a) - Q_\theta(s_t, a_t)) \, \nabla_\theta Q_\theta(s_t, a_t)$$

        * Improve greedily the learned policy:
        
        $$\pi(s_t, a) = \text{Greedy}(Q_\theta(s_t, a))$$

        * **if** $s_{t+1}$ is terminal: **break**

## Feature construction

{{< youtube  t39QwC_5vXI >}}

### Linear features

Before we dive into deep RL (i.e. RL with non-linear FA), let's see how we can design good **feature vectors** for linear function approximation. The problem with deep NN is that they need a lot of samples to converge, what worsens the fundamental problem of RL: **sample efficiency**. By engineering the right features, we could use linear approximators, which converge much faster. The convergence of linear FA is **guaranteed**, not (always) non-linear ones.

Why do we need to choose features? For the cartpole, the feature vector $\phi(s)$ could be:

$$ \phi(s) = \begin{bmatrix}x \\ \dot{x} \\ \theta \\ \dot{\theta} \end{bmatrix}$$

where $x$ is the position, $\theta$ the angle, $\dot{x}$ and $\dot{\theta}$ their derivatives. Can we predict the value of a state **linearly**?

$$V_\varphi(s) = \sum_{i=1}^d w_i \, \phi_i(s) = \mathbf{w}^T \times \phi(s)$$

This answer is no, as a high angular velocity $\dot{\theta}$ is good when the pole is horizontal (going up) but bad if the pole is vertical (will not stop). The value would depends linearly on something like $\dot{\theta} \, \sin \theta$, which is a non-linear combination of features.

Let's suppose we have a simple problem where the state $s$ is represented by two continuous variables $x$ and $y$. The true value function $V^\pi(s)$ is a non-linear function of $x$ and $y$.

![State values $V^\pi(s)$ for a two-dimensional state space.](../slides/img/featurecoding-data.png){width=60%}

If we apply linear FA directly on the feature vector $[x, y]$, we catch the tendency of $V^\pi(s)$ but we make a lot of bad predictions: **high bias** (underfitting).

![Linear approximation of the state value function.](../slides/img/featurecoding-linear.png){width=60%}

### Polynomial features

To introduce non-linear relationships between continuous variables, a simple method is to construct the feature with **polynomials** of the variables.

Example with polynomials of order 2:

$$
    \phi(s) = \begin{bmatrix}1 & x & y & x\, y & x^2 & y^2 \end{bmatrix}^T
$$

We transform the two input variables $x$ and $y$ into a vector with 6 elements. The 1 (order 0) is there to learn the offset / bias.

Example with polynomials of order 3:

$$
    \phi(s) = \begin{bmatrix}1 & x & y & x\, y & x^2 & y^2 & x^2 \, y & x \, y^2 & x^3 & y^3\end{bmatrix}^T
$$

We then just need to apply linear FA on these feature vectors (**polynomial regression**).

$$
    V_\varphi(s) = w_0 + w_1 \, x + w_2 \, y + w_3 \, x \, y + w_4 \, x^2 + w_5 \, y^2 + \ldots
$$

![Polynomial approximation of the state value function with order 2.](../slides/img/featurecoding-polynomial2.png){width=60%}

![Polynomial approximation of the state value function with order 6.](../slides/img/featurecoding-polynomial6.png){width=60%}

The higher the degree of the polynomial, the better the fit, but the number of features grows exponentially. This adds to the computational complexity and leads to **overfitting**: if we only sample some states, high-order polynomials will not interpolate correctly.


### Fourier transforms

Instead of approximating a state variable $x$ by a polynomial:

$$
    V_\varphi(s) = w_0 + w_1 \, x + w_2 \, x^2 + w_3 \, x^3 + \ldots
$$

we could also use its **Fourier decomposition** (here DCT, discrete cosine transform):

$$
    V_\varphi(s) = w_0 + w_1 \, \cos(\pi \, x) + w_2 \, \cos( 2 \, \pi \, x) + w_3 \, \cos(3 \, \pi \, x) + \ldots
$$

The Fourier theorem tells us that, if we take enough frequencies, we can reconstruct the signal $V_\varphi(s)$ perfectly.

![Fourier transform in 1D. Source: [@Sutton1998].](../slides/img/featurecoding-fourier1.png){width=100%}

It is just a change of basis, the problem stays a linear regression to find $w_0, w_1, w_2$, etc.

Fourier transforms can be applied on multivariate functions as well.

![Fourier transform in 2D. Source: [@Sutton1998].](../slides/img/featurecoding-fourier2.png){width=100%}

![Comparison of polynomial and Fourier features. Source: [@Sutton1998].](../slides/img/featurecoding-fourier3.png){width=100%}

A Fourier basis tends to work better than a polynomial basis. The main problem is that the number of features increases very fast with the number of input dimensions and  the desired precision (higher-order polynomials, more frequencies).

### Discrete coding

An obvious solution for continuous state variables is to **discretize** the input space. The input space is divided into a grid of non-overlapping **tiles**.

![Linear approximation of the state value function using discrete coding.](../slides/img/featurecoding-tile1.png){width=60%}

The feature vector is a **binary** vector with a 1 when the input is inside a tile, 0 otherwise.

$$\phi(s) = \begin{bmatrix}0 & 0 & \ldots & 0 & 1 & 0 & \ldots & 0 \\ \end{bmatrix}^T$$

This ensures **generalization** inside a tile: you only need a couple of samples inside a tile to know the mean value of all the states. Drawbacks: the value function is step-like (discontinuous), the correct size of a tile is not known, we fall into the **curse of dimensionality**.


### Coarse coding

A more efficient solution is **coarse coding**. The tiles (rectangles, circles, or what you need) need to **overlap**.

![Coarse coding uses overlapping tiles. Source: [@Sutton1998].](../slides/img/featurecoding-tile2.png){width=60%}

A state $s$ is encoded by a **binary vector**, but with several 1, for each tile it belongs.

$$\phi(s) = \begin{bmatrix}0 & 1 & 0 & \ldots & 1 & 1 & 0 & \ldots & 0 \\ \end{bmatrix}^T$$

This allows generalization inside a tile, but also **across tiles**. The size and shape of the **"receptive field"** influences the generalization properties.

![The overlap between tiles defines the generalization. Source: [@Sutton1998].](../slides/img/featurecoding-tile4.png){width=90%}


### Tile coding

A simple way to ensure that tiles overlap is to use several regular grids with an **offset**. Each tiling will be **coarse**, but the location of a state will be quite precise as it may belong to many tiles.

![Tile coding. Source: [@Sutton1998].](../slides/img/featurecoding-tile3.png){width=100%}

This helps against the curse of dimensionality: high precision, but the number of tiles does not grow exponentially.

### Radial-basis functions (RBF)

The feature vector in tile coding is a binary vector: there will be **discontinuous jumps** in the approximated value function when moving between tiles. We can use **radial-basis functions** (RBF) such as Gaussians to map the state space.

![Radial-basis functions.](../slides/img/featurecoding-rbf.png){width=100%}

We set a set of centers $\{c_i\}_{i=1}^K$ in the input space on a regular grid (or randomly). Each element of the feature vector will be a Gaussian function of the distance between the state $s$ and one center:

$$\phi_i(s) = \exp \frac{-(s - c_i)^2}{2\, \sigma_i^2}$$

The approximated value function now represents **continuously** the states:

$$V_\varphi(s) = \sum_{i=1}^d w_i \, \phi_i(s) = \sum_{i=1}^d w_i \, \exp \frac{-(s - c_i)^2}{2\, \sigma_i^2}$$

If you have enough centers and they overlap sufficiently, you can even **decode** the original state perfectly:

$$\hat{s} = \sum_{i=1}^d \phi_i(s) \, c_i$$

::: {.callout-note}
## Summary of function approximation

![](../slides/img/functionapproximation-state.svg){width=60%}

In FA, we project the state information into a **feature space** to get a better representation. We then apply a linear approximation algorithm to estimate the value function: 

$$V_\varphi(s) = \mathbf{w}^T \, \phi(s)$$

The linear FA is trained using some variant of gradient decent: 

$$\Delta \mathbf{w} = \eta \, (V^\pi(s) - V_\varphi(s)) \, \phi(s)$$

**Deep neural networks** are the most powerful function approximators in supervised learning.  Do they also work with RL?
