## Limits of deep reinforcement learning

{{< youtube  JDQdcTpHryM >}}


### Overview

**Model-free methods** (DQN, A3C, DDPG, PPO, SAC) are able to find optimal policies in complex MDPs by just **sampling** transitions.
They suffer however from a high **sample complexity**, i.e. they need ridiculous amounts of samples to converge.

**Model-based methods** (I2A, Dreamer, MuZero) use **learned dynamics** to predict the future and plan the consequences of an action.
The sample complexity is lower, but learning a good model can be challenging. Inference times can be prohibitive.

Deep RL is still very unstable. Depending on initialization, deep RL networks may or may not converge (30% of runs converge to a worse policy than a random agent).
Careful optimization such as TRPO / PPO help, but not completely.
You never know if failure is your fault (wrong network, bad hyperparameters, bug), or just bad luck.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Deep RL is popular because it&#39;s the only area in ML where it&#39;s socially acceptable to train on the test set.</p>&mdash; Jacob Andreas (@jacobandreas) <a href="https://twitter.com/jacobandreas/status/924356906344267776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 28, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


As it uses neural networks, deep RL **overfits** its training data, i.e. the environment it is trained on.
If you change anything to the environment dynamics, you need to retrain from scratch.
OpenAI Five collects 900 years of game experience per day on Dota 2: it overfits the game, it does not learn how to play.
Modify the map a little bit and everything is gone (but see Meta RL - RL$^2$ later).

Classical methods sometimes still work better. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is able to control Mujoco robots much better than RL through classical optimization techniques (e.g. iterative LQR) while needing much less computations.
If you have a good physics model, do not use DRL. Reserve it for unknown systems, or when using noisy sensors (images).
Genetic algorithms (CMA-ES) sometimes give better results than RL to train policy networks.

You cannot do that with deep RL (yet):

## Inverse RL - learning the reward function

{{< youtube  k-nr6Pwb9ds >}}

RL is an optimization method: it maximizes the reward function that you provide it.
If you do not design the reward function correctly, the agent may not do what you expect.
In the Coast runners game, turbos provide small rewards but respawn very fast: it is more optimal to collect them repeatedly than to try to finish the race.


{{< youtube  tlOIHko8ySg >}}


Defining the reward function that does what you want becomes an art.
RL algorithms work better with dense rewards than sparse ones. It is tempting to introduce intermediary rewards.
You end up covering so many special cases that it becomes unusable: Go as fast as you can but not in a curve, except if you are on a closed circuit but not if it rains...

{{< youtube  8QnD8ZM0YCo >}}

In the OpenAI **Lego stacking** paper [@Popov2017], it was perhaps harder to define the reward function than to implement DDPG.

![Lego stacking handmade reward function [@Popov2017].](../slides/img/lego_reward.png){width=100%}

The goal of **inverse RL** (see [@Arora2019] for a review) is to learn from **demonstrations** (e.g. from humans) which reward function is  maximized.
This is not **imitation learning**, where you try to learn and reproduce actions. 
The goal if to find a **parametrized representation** of the reward function:

$$\hat{r}(s) = \sum_{i=1}^K w_i \, \varphi_i(s)$$

When the reward function has been learned, you can train a RL algorithm to find the optimal policy.

## Intrinsic motivation and curiosity

One fundamental problem of RL is its dependence on the **reward function**. 
When rewards are **sparse**, the agent does not learn much (but see successor representations) unless its random exploration policy makes it discover rewards.
The reward function is **handmade**, what is difficult in realistic complex problems.

Human learning does not (only) rely on maximizing rewards or achieving goals.
Especially infants discover the world by **playing**, i.e. interacting with the environment out of **curiosity**.

> What happens if I do that? Oh, that's fun.

This called **intrinsic motivation**: we are motivated by understanding the world, not only by getting rewards.
Rewards are internally generated.

![In intrinsic motivation, rewards are generated internally depending on the achieved states. Source: [@Barto2013].](../slides/img/intrinsicmotivation.gif){width=50%}

What is **intrinsically** rewarding / motivating / fun? Mostly what has **unexpected** consequences.

* If you can predict what is going to happen, it becomes boring.
* If you cannot predict, you can become **curious** and try to **explore** that action.

![Intrinsic rewards are defined by the ability to predict states. Source: <https://medium.com/data-from-the-trenches/curiosity-driven-learning-through-next-state-prediction-f7f4e2f592fa>](../slides/img/intrinsicreward.png){width=100%}

The **intrinsic reward** (IR) of an action is defined as the sensory prediction error:

$$
    \text{IR}(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1}) = || f(s_t, a_t) - s_{t+1}||
$$

where $f(s_t, a_t)$ is a **forward model** predicting the sensory consequences of an action.
An agent maximizing the IR will tend to visit unknown / poorly predicted states (**exploration**). 


Is it a good idea to predict frames directly? Frames are highly dimensional and there will always be a remaining error.

![Intrinsic rewards are defined by the ability to predict states. Source: <https://medium.com/data-from-the-trenches/curiosity-driven-learning-through-next-state-prediction-f7f4e2f592fa>](../slides/img/intrinsicreward-hard.png){width=100%}

Moreover, they can be noisy and unpredictable, without being particularly interesting.

![Falling leaves are hard to predict, but hardly interesting. Source: Giphy.](../slides/img/leaves.gif){width=50%}

What can we do? As usual, predict in a latent space!

The intrinsic curiosity module (ICM, [@Pathak2017]) learns to provide an intrinsic reward for a transition $(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1})$ by comparing the predicted latent representation $\hat{\phi}(s_{t+1})$ (using a **forward** model) to its "true" latent representation $\phi(s_{t+1})$.
The feature representation $\phi(s_t)$ is trained using an **inverse model** predicting the action leading from $s_t$ to $s_{t+1}$.

## Hierarchical RL - learning different action levels

{{< youtube  O7cKkOzWn3s >}}

In all previous RL methods, the action space is fixed.
When you read a recipe, the actions are "Cut carrots", "Boil water", etc.
But how do you perform these **high-level actions**? Break them into subtasks iteratively until you arrive to muscle activations.
But it is not possible to learn to cook a boeuf bourguignon using muscle activations as actions.


![Hierarchical structure of preparing a boeuf bourguignon. Source: <https://thegradient.pub/the-promise-of-hierarchical-reinforcement-learning/>](../slides/img/hierarchicalRL.png){width=100%}

Sub-policies (**options**) can be trained to solve simple tasks (going left, right, etc).
A **meta-learner** or controller then learns to call each sub-policy when needed, at a much lower frequency [@Frans2017].

## Meta Reinforcement learning - RL$^2$ 

**Meta learning** is the ability to reuse skills acquired on a set of tasks to quickly acquire new (similar) ones (generalization).


![](../slides/img/metalearning.png){width=100%}
![Meta Reinforcement learning. Source: <https://meta-world.github.io/>](../slides/img/ml10.gif){width=100%}



Meta RL is based on the idea of **fast and slow** learning:
* Slow learning is the adaptation of weights in the NN.
* Fast learning is the adaptation to changes in the environment.

A simple strategy developed concurrently by [@Wang2017a] and [@Duan2016a]is to have a model-free algorithm (e.g. A3C) integrate with a LSTM layer not only the current state $s_t$, but also the previous action $a_{t-1}$ and reward $r_t$.

![Meta RL uses a LSTM layer to encode past actions and rewards in the state representation. Source: [@Wang2017a]](../slides/img/metarl-lstm.png){width=30%}


The policy of the agent becomes **memory-guided**: it selects an action depending on what it did before, not only the state.


![Meta RL algorithms are trained on a set of similar MDPs. Source: [@Duan2016a]](../slides/img/RL_2.png){width=100%}

The algorithm is trained on a set of similar MDPs:

1. Select a MDP $\mathcal{M}$.
2. Reset the internal state of the LSTM.
3. Sample trajectories and adapt the weights.
4. Repeat 1, 2 and 3.


The meta RL can be be trained an a multitude of 2-armed bandits, each giving a reward of 1 with probability $p$ and $1-p$.
Left is a classical bandit algorithm, right is the meta bandit:

![Classical bandit (left) and meta-bandit (right) learning a new two-armed bandit problem. Source: <https://hackernoon.com/learning-policies-for-learning-policies-meta-reinforcement-learning-rl%C2%B2-in-tensorflow-b15b592a2ddf>](../slides/img/metarl-twoarmed.gif){width=70%}

The meta bandit has learned that the best strategy for any 2-armed bandit is to sample both actions randomly at the beginning and then stick to the best one.
The meta bandit does not learn to solve each problem, it learns **how** to solve them.
