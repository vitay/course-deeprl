# Problems with stochastic policy gradient methods

* Actor-critic methods are strictly **on-policy**: the transitions used to train the critic **must** be generated by the current version of the actor.

$$
    \nabla_\theta \mathcal{J}(\theta) =  \mathbb{E}_{s_t \sim \rho_\theta, a_t \sim \pi_\theta}[\nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta (s_t, a_t) \, (R_t - V_\varphi(s_t)) ]
$$

$$
    \mathcal{L}(\varphi) =  \mathbb{E}_{s_t \sim \rho_\theta, a_t \sim \pi_\theta}[(R_t - V_\varphi(s_t))^2]
$$

* Past transitions cannot be reused to train the actor (no replay memory).

* Domain knowledge cannot be used to guide the exploration.

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}


* The learned policy $\pi_\theta(s, a)$ is **stochastic**. This generates a lot of **variance** in the obtained returns, therefore in the gradients.

* This can greatly impair learning (bad convergence) and slow it down (sample complexity).

* We would not have this problem if the policy was **deterministic** as in off-policy methods.

# Deterministic policy gradient theorem

* The objective function that we tried to maximize until now is :

$$
    \mathcal{J}(\theta) =  \mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \rho_\theta}[R(\tau)]
$$

i.e. we want the returns of all trajectories generated by the **stochastic policy** $\pi_\theta$ to be maximal.


::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=60%}

* It is equivalent to say that we want the value of **all** states visited by the policy $\pi_\theta$ to be maximal:

    * a policy $\pi$ is better than another policy $\pi'$ if its expected return is greater or equal than that of $\pi'$ for all states $s$.

    $$\pi > \pi' \Leftrightarrow V^{\pi}(s) > V^{\pi'}(s) \quad \forall s \in \mathcal{S}$$

:::
::: {.column width=40%}

![](img/policysearch.svg){width=80%}

* The objective function can be rewritten as:

$$
    \mathcal{J}'(\theta) =  \mathbb{E}_{s \sim \rho_\theta}[V^{\pi_\theta}(s)]
$$

where $\rho_\theta$ is now the **state visitation distribution**, i.e. how often a state will be visited by the policy $\pi_\theta$.


# Deterministic policy gradient theorem

* The two objective functions:

$$
    \mathcal{J}(\theta) =  \mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \rho_\theta}[R(\tau)]
$$

and:

$$
    \mathcal{J}'(\theta) =  \mathbb{E}_{s \sim \rho_\theta}[V^{\pi_\theta}(s)]
$$

are not the same: $\mathcal{J}$ has different values than $\mathcal{J}'$.

* However, they have a maximum for the same **optimal policy** $\pi^*$ and their gradients are the same:

$$
    \nabla_\theta \, \mathcal{J}(\theta) =  \nabla_\theta \, \mathcal{J}'(\theta)
$$

* If a change in the policy $\pi_\theta$ increases the return of all trajectories, it also increases the value of the visited states. 

* Take-home message: their **policy gradient** is the same, we have the right to re-define the problem like this.

$$
   g = \nabla_\theta \, \mathcal{J}(\theta) =  \mathbb{E}_{s \sim \rho_\theta}[\nabla_\theta \, V^{\pi_\theta}(s)]
$$

# Deterministic policy gradient theorem

* When introducing Q-values, we obtain the following policy gradient:

$$
   g = \nabla_\theta \, \mathcal{J}(\theta) =  \mathbb{E}_{s \sim \rho_\theta}[\nabla_\theta \, V^{\pi_\theta}(s)] =  \mathbb{E}_{s \sim \rho_\theta}[\sum_a \nabla_\theta \, \pi_\theta(s, a) \, Q^{\pi_\theta}(s, a)]
$$

* This formulation necessitates to integrate overall possible actions. 

    * Not possible with continuous action spaces.

    * The stochastic policy adds a lot of variance.

* But let's suppose that the policy is **deterministic**, i.e. it takes a single action in state $s$.

* We can note this deterministic policy $\mu_\theta(s)$, with:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \mu_\theta :  \; \mathcal{S} & \rightarrow \mathcal{A} \\
    s & \; \rightarrow \mu_\theta(s) \\
\end{aligned}
$$



# Deterministic policy gradient theorem

* The policy gradient for the deterministic policy $\mu_\theta(s)$ becomes:

$$
   g = \nabla_\theta \, \mathcal{J}(\theta) =  \mathbb{E}_{s \sim \rho_\theta}[\nabla_\theta \, Q^{\mu_\theta}(s, \mu_\theta(s))]
$$

::: {}
![](img/dpg-chainrule.png){width=80%}
:::


* We can now use the chain rule to decompose the gradient of $Q^{\mu_\theta}(s, \mu_\theta(s))$:

$$\nabla_\theta \, Q^{\mu_\theta}(s, \mu_\theta(s)) = \nabla_a \, Q^{\mu_\theta}(s, a)|_{a = \mu_\theta(s)} \times \nabla_\theta \, \mu_\theta(s)$$

* $\nabla_a \, Q^{\mu_\theta}(s, a)|_{a = \mu_\theta(s)}$ means that we differentiate $Q^{\mu_\theta}$ w.r.t. $a$, and evaluate it in $\mu_\theta(s)$.

    * $a$ is a variable, but $\mu_\theta(s)$ is a deterministic value (constant).

* $\nabla_\theta \, \mu_\theta(s)$ tells how the output of the policy network varies with the parameters of NN:

    * Automatic differentiation frameworks such as tensorflow can tell you that.

# Deterministic policy gradient theorem

> For any MDP, the **deterministic policy gradient** is:

$$\nabla_\theta \, \mathcal{J}(\theta) =  \mathbb{E}_{s \sim \rho_\theta}[\nabla_a \, Q^{\mu_\theta}(s, a)|_{a = \mu_\theta(s)} \times \nabla_\theta \, \mu_\theta(s)]$$


* As always, you do not know the true Q-value $Q^{\mu_\theta}(s, a)$, because you search for the policy $\mu_\theta$.

* @Silver2014 showed that you can safely (without introducing any bias) replace the true Q-value with an estimate $Q_\varphi(s, a)$, as long as the estimate minimizes the mse with the TD target:

$$Q_\varphi(s, a) \approx Q^{\mu_\theta}(s, a)$$

$$\mathcal{L}(\varphi) = \mathbb{E}_{s \sim \rho_\theta}[(r(s, \mu_\theta(s)) + \gamma \, Q_\varphi(s', \mu_\theta(s')) - Q_\varphi(s, \mu_\theta(s)))^2]$$

* We come back to an actor-critic architecture:

    * The **deterministic actor** $\mu_\theta(s)$ selects a single action in state $s$.

    * The **critic** $Q_\varphi(s, a)$ estimates the value of that action. 



# Deterministic Policy Gradient as an actor-critic architecture

![](img/dpg.png){width=90%}

**Training the actor:**

$$
    \nabla_\theta \mathcal{J}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{s \sim \rho_\theta}[\nabla_\theta \, \mu_\theta(s) \times \nabla_a Q_\varphi(s, a) |_{a = \mu_\theta(s)}]
$$

**Training the critic:**

$$
    \mathcal{L}(\varphi) = \mathbb{E}_{s \sim \rho_\theta}[(r(s, \mu_\theta(s)) + \gamma \, Q_\varphi(s', \mu_\theta(s')) - Q_\varphi(s, \mu_\theta(s)))^2]
$$

# DPG is off-policy

* If you act off-policy, i.e. you visit the states $s$ using a **behavior policy** $b$, you would theoretically need to correct the policy gradient with **importance sampling**:

$$
    \nabla_\theta \mathcal{J}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{s \sim \rho_b}[\sum_a \, \frac{\pi_\theta(s, a)}{b(s, a)} \, \nabla_\theta \, \mu_\theta(s) \times \nabla_a Q_\varphi(s, a) |_{a = \mu_\theta(s)}]
$$

* But your policy is now **deterministic**: the actor only takes the action $a=\mu_\theta(s)$ with probability 1, not $\pi(s, a)$.

* The **importance weight** is 1 for that action, 0 for the other. You can safely sample states from a behavior policy, it won't affect the deterministic policy gradient:

$$
    \nabla_\theta \mathcal{J}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{s \sim \rho_b}[\nabla_\theta \, \mu_\theta(s) \times \nabla_a Q_\varphi(s, a) |_{a = \mu_\theta(s)}]
$$

* The critic uses Q-learning, so it is also off-policy.

* **DPG is an off-policy actor-critic architecture!**

# DDPG: Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient

* As the name indicates, DDPG is the deep variant of DPG for **continuous control**.

* It uses the DQN tricks to stabilize learning with deep networks:

:::
::: {.column width=50%}


* As DPG is **off-policy**, an **experience replay memory** can be used to sample experiences.

* The **actor** $\mu_\theta$ learns using sampled transitions with DPG.

* The **critic** $Q_\varphi$ uses Q-learning on sampled transitions: **target networks** can be used to cope with the non-stationarity of the Bellman targets.

:::
:::


* Contrary to DQN, the target networks are not updated every once in a while, but slowly **integrate** the trained networks after each update (moving average of the weights):

$$\theta' \leftarrow \tau \theta + (1-\tau) \, \theta'$$

$$\varphi' \leftarrow \tau \varphi + (1-\tau) \, \varphi'$$


# DDPG: Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient

![](img/ddpg.png){width=70%}

* A deterministic actor is good for learning (less variance), but not for exploring.

* We cannot use $\epsilon$-greedy or softmax, as the actor outputs directly the policy, not Q-values.

* For continuous actions, an **exploratory noise** can be added to the deterministic action:

$$a_t = \mu_\theta(s_t) + \xi_t$$

* Ex: if the actor wants to move the joint of a robot by $2^o$, it will actually be moved from $2.1^o$ or $1.9^o$.

# Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic process


* In DDPG, an **Ornstein-Uhlenbeck** stochastic process is used to add noise to the continuous actions.

* It is defined by a **stochastic differential equation**, classically used to describe Brownian motion:

$$ dx_t = \theta (\mu - x_t) dt + \sigma dW_t \qquad \text{with} \qquad dW_t = \mathcal{N}(0, dt)$$

* The temporal mean of $x_t$ is $\mu= 0$, its amplitude is $\theta$ (exploration level), its speed is $\sigma$.

* Another approach to ensure exploration is to add noise to the **parameters** $\theta$ of the actor at inference time.

* For the same input $s_t$, the output $\mu_\theta(s_t)$ will be different every time.

* The **NoisyNet** approach can be applied to any deep RL algorithm to enable a smart state-dependent exploration (e.g. Noisy DQN).

# DDPG: Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient

* Initialize actor network $\mu_{\theta}$ and critic $Q_\varphi$, target networks $\mu_{\theta'}$ and $Q_{\varphi'}$,  ERM $\mathcal{D}$ of maximal size $N$, random process $\xi$.

* for $t \in [0, T_\text{max}]$:

    * Select the action $a_t = \mu_\theta(s_t) + \xi$ and store $(s_t, a_t, r_{t+1}, s_{t+1})$ in the ERM.
        
    * For each transition $(s_k, a_k, r_k, s'_k)$ in a minibatch of $K$ transitions randomly sampled from $\mathcal{D}$:
        * Compute the target value using target networks $t_k = r_k + \gamma \, Q_{\varphi'}(s'_k, \mu_{\theta'}(s'_k))$.
        
    * Update the critic by minimizing:
    $$\mathcal{L}(\varphi) = \frac{1}{K} \sum_k (t_k - Q_\varphi(s_k, a_k))^2$$
        
    * Update the actor by applying the deterministic policy gradient:
    $$\nabla_\theta \mathcal{J}(\theta) = \frac{1}{K} \sum_k \nabla_\theta \mu_\theta(s_k) \times \nabla_a Q_\varphi(s_k, a) |_{a = \mu_\theta(s_k)}$$
        
    * Update the target networks: $\theta' \leftarrow \tau \theta + (1-\tau) \, \theta' \; ; \; \varphi' \leftarrow \tau \varphi + (1-\tau) \, \varphi'$

# DDPG: Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient

![](img/ddpg.png){width=70%}

* DDPG allows to learn continuous policies: there can be one tanh output neuron per joint in a robot.

* The learned policy is deterministic: this simplifies learning as we do not need to integrate over the action space after sampling.

* Exploratory noise (e.g. Ohrstein-Uhlenbeck) has to be added to the selected action during learning in order to ensure exploration.

* Allows to use an experience replay memory, reusing past samples (better sample complexity than A3C).

# TD3 - Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=60%}

* As any Q-learning-based method, DDPG **overestimates** Q-values.

* The Bellman target $t = r + \gamma \, \max_{a'} Q(s', a')$ uses a maximum over other values, so it is increasingly overestimated during learning.

* After a while, the overestimated Q-values disrupt training in the actor.

:::
::: {.column width=40%}

![](img/td3-overestimation.png)

:::
:::


* Double Q-learning solves the problem by using the target network $\theta'$ to estimate Q-values, but the value network $\theta$ to select the greedy action in the next state:

$$
    \mathcal{L}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_\mathcal{D} [(r + \gamma \, Q_{\theta'}(s´, \text{argmax}_{a'} Q_{\theta}(s', a')) - Q_\theta(s, a))^2]
$$

* The idea is to use two different independent networks to reduce overestimation.

* This does not work well with DDPG, as the Bellman target $t = r + \gamma \, Q_{\varphi'}(s', \mu_{\theta'}(s'))$ uses a target actor network that is not very different from the trained deterministic actor.

# TD3 - Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient


* TD3 uses two critics $\varphi_1$ and $\varphi_2$ (and target critics): 

    * the Q-value used to train the actor will be the **lesser of two evils**, i.e. the minimum Q-value:

$$t = r + \gamma \, \min(Q_{\varphi'_1}(s', \mu_{\theta'}(s')), Q_{\varphi'_2}(s', \mu_{\theta'}(s')))$$

* One of the critic will always be less over-estimating than the other. Better than nothing...

* Using twin critics is called **clipped double learning**.



* Both critics learn in parallel using the same target:

$$\mathcal{L}(\varphi_1) = \mathbb{E}[(t - Q_{\varphi_1}(s, a))^2] \qquad ; \qquad \mathcal{L}(\varphi_2) = \mathbb{E}[ (t - Q_{\varphi_2}(s, a))^2]$$

* The actor is trained using the first critic only:

$$\nabla_\theta \mathcal{J}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}[ \nabla_\theta \mu_\theta(s) \times \nabla_a Q_{\varphi_1}(s, a) |_{a = \mu_\theta(s)} ]$$



# TD3 - Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient


::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=70%}

* Another issue with actor-critic architecture in general is that the critic is always biased during training, what can impact the actor and ultimately collapse the policy:

$$\nabla_\theta \mathcal{J}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}[ \nabla_\theta \mu_\theta(s) \times \nabla_a Q_{\varphi_1}(s, a) |_{a = \mu_\theta(s)} ]$$

$$Q_{\varphi_1}(s, a) \approx Q^{\mu_\theta}(s, a)$$


* The critic should learn much faster than the actor in order to provide **unbiased** gradients.

:::
::: {.column width=30%}

![](img/nonstationarity3.svg)

:::
:::



* Increasing the learning rate in the critic creates instability, reducing the learning rate in the actor slows down learning.

* The solution proposed by TD3 is to **delay** the update of the actor, i.e. update it only every $d$ minibatches:

    * Train the critics $\varphi_1$ and $\varphi_2$ on the minibatch.

    * **every** $d$ steps:

        * Train the actor $\theta$ on the minibatch.

* This leaves enough time to the critics to improve their prediction and provides less biased gradients to the actor.



# TD3 - Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient

* A last problem with deterministic policies is that they tend to always select the same actions $\mu_\theta(s)$ (overfitting).

* For exploration, some additive noise is added to the selected action:

$$a = \mu_\theta(s) + \xi$$

* But this is not true for the Bellman targets, which use the deterministic action:

$$t = r + \gamma \, Q_{\varphi}(s', \mu_{\theta}(s'))$$

* TD3 proposes to also use additive noise in the Bellman targets:

$$t = r + \gamma \, Q_{\varphi}(s', \mu_{\theta}(s') + \xi)$$

* If the additive noise is zero on average, the Bellman targets will be correct on average (unbiased) but will prevent overfitting of particular actions.

* The additive noise does not have to be an **Ornstein-Uhlenbeck** stochastic process, but could simply be a random variable:

$$\xi \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)$$

---

* Initialize actor $\mu_{\theta}$, critics $Q_{\varphi_1}, Q_{\varphi_2}$, target networks $\mu_{\theta'}, Q_{\varphi_1'},Q_{\varphi_2'}$,  ERM $\mathcal{D}$, random processes $\xi_1, \xi_2$.

* for $t \in [0, T_\text{max}]$:

    * Select the action $a_t = \mu_\theta(s_t) + \xi_1$ and store $(s_t, a_t, r_{t+1}, s_{t+1})$ in the ERM.
        
    * For each transition $(s_k, a_k, r_k, s'_k)$ in a minibatch sampled from $\mathcal{D}$:
        * Compute the target $t_k = r_k + \gamma \, \min(Q_{\varphi_1'}(s'_k, \mu_{\theta'}(s'_k) + \xi_2), Q_{\varphi_2'}(s'_k, \mu_{\theta'}(s'_k) + \xi_2))$.
        
    * Update the critics by minimizing:
    $$\mathcal{L}(\varphi_1) = \frac{1}{K} \sum_k (t_k - Q_{\varphi_1}(s_k, a_k))^2 \qquad ; \qquad \mathcal{L}(\varphi_2) = \frac{1}{K} \sum_k (t_k - Q_{\varphi_2}(s_k, a_k))^2$$
        
    * **every** $d$ steps:
        * Update the actor by applying the DPG using $Q_{\varphi_1}$:
        $$\nabla_\theta \mathcal{J}(\theta) = \frac{1}{K} \sum_k \nabla_\theta \mu_\theta(s_k) \times \nabla_a Q_{\varphi_1}(s_k, a) |_{a = \mu_\theta(s_k)}$$
        
        * Update the target networks: 
        $$\theta' \leftarrow \tau \theta + (1-\tau) \, \theta' \; ; \; \varphi_1' \leftarrow \tau \varphi_1 + (1-\tau) \, \varphi_1' \; ; \; \varphi_2' \leftarrow \tau \varphi_2 + (1-\tau) \, \varphi_2'$$

# D4PG: Distributed Distributional DDPG

* **Deterministic policy gradient** as in DDPG:
$$\nabla_\theta \mathcal{J}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{s \sim \rho_b}[\nabla_\theta \mu_\theta(s) \times \nabla_a \mathbb{E} [\mathcal{Z}_\varphi(s, a)] |_{a = \mu_\theta(s)}]$$

* **Distributional critic**: The critic does not predict single Q-values $Q_\varphi(s, a)$, but the distribution of returns $\mathcal{Z}_\varphi(s, a)$ (as in Categorical DQN):
$$\mathcal{L}(\varphi) = \mathbb{E}_{s \in \rho_b} [ \text{KL}(\mathcal{T} \, \mathcal{Z}_\varphi(s, a) || \mathcal{Z}_\varphi(s, a))]$$

* **n-step** returns (as in A3C):
$$\mathcal{T} \, \mathcal{Z}_\varphi(s_t, a_t)= \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \gamma^{k} \, r_{t+k+1} + \gamma^n \, \mathcal{Z}_\varphi(s_{t+n}, \mu_\theta(s_{t+n}))$$

* **Distributed workers**: D4PG uses $K=32$ or $64$ copies of the actor to fill the ERM in parallel.

* **Prioritized Experience Replay** (PER): $P(k) = \frac{(|\delta_k| + \epsilon)^\alpha}{\sum_k (|\delta_k| + \epsilon)^\alpha}$
